# 🌍 Why I Built This GitHub Homepage

Hi, I'm **Lisa Pang**, founder of [Roadnavier](https://roadnavier.com), a one-person DTC brand selling Android screens and digital clusters for car owners worldwide. I’m based in Shenzhen, but my market is global — especially the U.S.

## 🤔 Why a GitHub Homepage?

Most people think GitHub is for developers. I did too — until I realized:

> **In the AI era, every creator needs a structured, trusted place to showcase their digital work.**

This repo is that place for me.

---

### ✅ 3 Reasons I Built This Page

**1. A Place to Show Credibility, Not Just Products**  
I'm tired of writing “marketing speak.” GitHub lets me show what I’m really doing — how I automate my Shopify workflows, build Pinterest content systems, and create my own GPT tools.

**2. A Trusted Entry Point for Global Buyers**  
When American customers discover me on Pinterest or YouTube, they might hesitate to click a random Shopify link. But when I show them my GitHub profile? It builds **instant credibility**.

**3. A Way to Structure My Thinking**  
This page isn't just for others — it's for me. Writing this README helps me reflect, organize, and productize everything I’ve built so far.

### 📦 What You'll Find Here

- 🔧 **My Shopify automation workflows** (Zapier & Make)
